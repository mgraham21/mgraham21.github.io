## Mariah Chavez-Graham

Just a quirky girl in a regular world. ðŸŒŽ

I love learning new skills whether waiting tables, learning about pharmaceuticals, mailing packages in a post office, or the tons of types of arts and crafts floating in my brain.

Work or hobbies, I always work hard to get the job done.
My passion is to learn all there is that I can learn and to do them all well.
Learning Java and Developing Android apps in the Java + Android DeepDive Bootcamp; after completion, I would love to get an internship and continue my education.
